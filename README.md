# Consolemon
A Pokemon battle simulator written in Kotlin, conaitned entirely within the console. This is really just a starter project to get me familiarised with Kotlin, so only Arceus, Missingno (for fun) and their basic movesets will be implemented. Everything will follow gen IX specifications, except if they do not exist in gen IX. In that case, they are based on the last generation where they are found. Note that the intricacies of the system may not exactly match the games due to differing execution order.
